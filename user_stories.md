## As a business owner, I want to display potential products to my future buyers so that I may get a feel for what my market wants to buy.

## As a user I want to have a clean interface so I can select products quickly.

## As a product provider, I want my customers to see my product as often as they might see any other company's products.

## As an advertiser, I want to see a website that attracts lots of viewers so that I can display my ads to as many people as possible.
